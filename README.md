# WGU Algorithms

Algorithms inspired by the course material.  

## Example Classes to inspire you:
- Calculus
- Probability and Stats
- Data Structures and Algorithms 1 & 2
- Discrete Mathematics 1 & 2

# Layout for .md algorithm files
 - *Be sure to site all of your resources!!*
 - Make sure your algorithm is within the correct class folder within this repository
 - If you see any typos or issues with any of the algorithms please open an [issue](https://github.com/WGU-BSCS/algorithms/issues) for it
 - These files are in Markdown. Here is the [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
 
## Formatting for every algorithm-name.md file is provided below
  - From within your editor of choice copy and paste the code below into your new algorithm-name.md file

## TODO:
- [ ] Move algorithms in [unsorted-algorithms.md](https://github.com/WGU-BSCS/algorithms/blob/master/discrete-math-2/unsorted-algorithms.md) to separate files
- [ ] List programming languages to use
- [ ] Add to inspiration class list
- [ ] Make a folder for each class
- [ ] Add instructions for the proper way of adding a file to each folder for each langauge
- [ ] Find other WGUers to help :)
