# Create Environment
## Anaconda
[anaconda docs](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
- `conda create --name myenv`
- `pip install spotipy`
	- although it is reccomended to use `conda install libname`, conda does not currently have spotipy in its choices so I used pip with no problems

# Get Spotify Dev ID

- follow prompts, agree to terms, etc.
